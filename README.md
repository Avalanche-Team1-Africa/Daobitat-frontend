![DAO-Bitat Banner](https://your-image-url.com/banner.png)

## Project Repositories

This project is split across three repositories:

1. **Frontend (Current Repository)**: [daobitat-public](https://github.com/WankioM/daobitat-public)
   - Main public repository containing the user interface and client-side logic

2. **Backend**: [daobitat-backend](https://github.com/WankioM/daobitat-backend)
   - Backend repository (temporarily public)
   - Contains API endpoints, database management, and server-side logic

3. **Smart Contracts**:
Our platform leverages various smart contracts to ensure secure, automated, and transparent processes for property rentals and transactions. Below are the key contracts and their functions:

Property Registry Contract
The Property Registry Contract handles all aspects of property listings and ownership records, ensuring the integrity and verification of property details on the blockchain.

Key Features:

Manages property listings and ownership records
Stores property metadata and verification status
Key Functions:

registerProperty(): Registers a new property listing.
updateListing(): Updates existing property details.
verifyProperty(): Verifies the ownership and legitimacy of the property.
Escrow Contract
The Escrow Contract ensures that rent payments and security deposits are held securely, with funds released only when conditions are met, providing protection to both landlords and tenants.

Key Features:

Manages security deposits and rent payments
Holds funds in escrow until the agreed-upon conditions are met
Handles automated rent disbursement
Key Functions:

depositRent(): Deposits rent payments into the escrow account.
releaseFunds(): Releases funds to the property owner when conditions are satisfied.
refundDeposit(): Refunds the security deposit if lease terms are met or the agreement is terminated.
Tenancy Agreement Contract
The Tenancy Agreement Contract automates the creation, signing, and management of rental agreements, ensuring both landlords and tenants are bound by the terms of the contract.

Key Features:

Manages rental agreements and terms
Stores tenant history and payment records
Handles lease signing and renewals
Key Functions:

createAgreement(): Creates a new tenancy agreement between the tenant and landlord.
signLease(): Allows both parties to digitally sign the lease agreement.
terminateLease(): Terminates a lease agreement, releasing the tenant from obligations.
Access Control Contract
The Access Control Contract is designed to manage user roles, ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform certain actions. It handles identity verification and permission assignments.

Key Features:

Manages user roles (admin, property owner, tenant)
Handles identity verification
Controls permissions for various operations
Key Functions:

verifyIdentity(): Verifies the identity of users, ensuring they are who they claim to be.
assignRole(): Assigns roles such as admin, property owner, or tenant to users.
checkPermission(): Checks if a user has the necessary permissions to perform a specific operation.
These smart contracts enable a seamless, secure, and transparent experience for both property owners and tenants, leveraging blockchain technology for trustless transactions and automated processes.

DAO-Bitat is a decentralized property listing platform that revolutionizes real estate investing through blockchain technology. Our platform brings transparency, accessibility, and democratization to real estate investments by enabling fractional ownership of Real World Assets (RWA).
